--Then I will select the "Employee sheet" table from the database


SELECT *

--Or, If I want to be more specific and select the database with the employee sheet, 
--then I would type this in


SELECT *
FROM DataDB.dbo.EmployeeSheet


--All of the datas are being shown here. If I want to select just the first 
--and last name of all of the employees, I would type this and execute it.

--To be more specific, if I want the first and last name of the employees with Employee IDs from
--1001 to 1015, this is what I would type

--This will show which employees live in Garden Grove who also have a salary under $50,000

--This will show all of the male employees who work in the Logistics department

--I would type it like this

--By typing this and executing it, I would find out which employees are equal to or less than 25 years old

--In order to find the names of the locations that start with the letter 'G' or ends with the little 'e', 
--I would type it like this. The results will show "Garden Grove" and "Eastvale"

--Or if I don't want a location that has the word "Garden Grove" in it, 
--then this is what I would type without showing any repeats of the locations. 


SELECT DISTINCT Location

--As for the first name column, I can find out which employee has the first name that starts with the 
--Letter T and has a G somewhere in their name by typing this. This will show "Trung"


SELECT FirstName
FROM EmployeeSheet
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'T%G%';


--The following steps will show me all of the employees who are in the logistics and janitorial departments


SELECT *
FROM EmployeeSheet
WHERE Department IN ('Logistics', 'Janitorial')


--This will determine how many counts of Salaries are there from the Employee Sheet table.


SELECT COUNT (Salary) AS SalaryCount
FROM EmployeeSheet


--This will show the most amount of salary from the employee sheet


SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM EmployeeSheet


--Whereas this will show the least amount of salary from the employee sheet


SELECT MIN(Salary)
FROM EmployeeSheet


--This will also show the average of the salary among all of the employees


SELECT AVG(Salary)
FROM EmployeeSheet


--This will show how many employees are males and females


SELECT Gender, COUNT(Gender) AS GenderCount

GROUP BY Gender
